# FORM Design Kit â€“ Beta 0.0.4 (May 2019)

The FORM Design Kit is a universal design resource for Mitel's Marketing Technology team.  It contains all of our visual design assets related to mitel.com(color, typography, iconography, grids, elements, components and more).  This document evolves as changes as we add new components, adjust styling and collaborate with teams across the company.

## :hatching_chick: New to Git?
If you're new to using git, checkout the [newbie guide](https://github.com/Mitel-Martech/form-design-kit/wiki/Newbie-Guide) in our wiki to get yourself setup.  Experienced folks can proceed below.

## :bulb: Getting Started
This tutorial assumes you already have access to Museo Sans and have [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) installed.  If you are missing either of these, speak to a member of the Marketing Technology team to discuss getting these setup.

### :exclamation: Git LFS
In order to properly pull assets from this repo you need to have [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) setup and installed.  *Users with versions 0.0.3 or earlier will need to install this and clone this repo again.*

### Basic Usage:
* Open the Design Kit file in Sketch
* Styles, elements, components and templates are broken out into their respective pages
* Use symbols and styles to build out your design.  Make use of existing components whenever possible, we should only be creating net new assets when absolutely necessary.
* Updates to the Design Kit will be posted in our change log, so check back frequently to stay up-to-date(Martech team members will be notified of changes directly).

### Recommended:
* Review [Symbols](https://sketchapp.com/docs/symbols/) within Sketch and familiarize yourself with usage & techniques.
* Install the [Sketch Palettes](https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes) plugin, this will allow you to import `mitel-colors.sketchpalette` into new and existing documents, giving you access to the martech color palette.
* Install the [Shared Text Styles](http://www.textstyl.es/) plugin, this will allow you to import `mitel-text-styles.json` into new and existing documents, giving you access to martech text styles.
* Importing can be done through the Sketch Plugins menu once associated plugins are installed.
